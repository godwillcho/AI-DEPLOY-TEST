REFERRAL PATH OVERVIEW — Stability360 by Trident United Way

WHAT IS A REFERRAL?
When a client's needs are best served by a community partner agency rather than
direct Stability360 case management, the AI intake system generates a referral.
The referral packages the client's information and connects them with the
appropriate provider.

REFERRAL VS DIRECT SUPPORT
- REFERRAL: Client is connected to an external community partner that
  specializes in their specific need.  The client contacts the partner directly
  or the partner contacts the client.  Stability360 follows up to ensure
  connection was made.
- DIRECT SUPPORT: Client's case is handled by the Stability360 case management
  team.  A case manager is assigned and works directly with the client through
  the full process.

LIGHT-TOUCH REFERRAL
Some needs require only a brief connection — for example, providing a phone
number, address, or website for a specific service.  In these cases:
- The AI provides the resource information directly during the chat
- No formal referral packet is generated
- A brief follow-up may be scheduled to confirm the client connected

FULL REFERRAL
For more complex needs, a formal referral packet is created:
- Client information (name, contact, county, ZIP)
- Need category and subcategories
- Relevant intake answers
- Conversation summary
- Recommended provider(s)
- The packet is sent to the receiving agency and the client

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A REFERRAL
1. Client receives a summary of the referral and provider contact information
2. The receiving agency is notified (if applicable)
3. An automated follow-up is scheduled (typically 7 days)
4. The follow-up checks whether the client connected with the provider
5. If the client was unable to connect, additional options are offered

TYPICAL REFERRAL TIMELINE
- Day 0: Referral generated during intake chat
- Day 0-1: Client contacts provider (or provider contacts client)
- Day 7: Automated follow-up via preferred contact method
- Day 14: Second follow-up if no response to first
- Day 30: Case closed if no further contact needed
