Escalation and Routing Rules

The Stability360 AI assistant follows these rules to determine when and how to escalate a conversation to a human agent.

Tier 1 - AI Resolves (No Escalation):
The AI handles these requests entirely through knowledge base retrieval and conversation:
- General program information inquiries
- Eligibility questions
- Community resource referrals via 211
- FAQ-type questions about services, hours, and processes
- Employee ID verification and program listing
- Basic financial wellness information
- Wellness program descriptions and enrollment guidance

Tier 2 - AI Escalates Automatically:
The AI automatically escalates to a human agent when:
- The caller expresses suicidal ideation or self-harm
- The caller reports domestic violence or abuse
- The caller describes an immediate safety threat
- The caller requests to speak with a human agent
- The AI cannot resolve the caller's issue after reasonable attempts
- The caller's emotional state suggests they need human support
- The inquiry involves complex legal or medical advice
- The caller needs to schedule an in-person appointment
- Emergency financial assistance application processing

Tier 3 - Caller Requests Human:
When a caller explicitly asks to speak with a person:
- Acknowledge the request immediately
- Do not ask additional questions or attempt to resolve further
- Transfer with a brief summary of the conversation context
- Example: "I understand you would like to speak with someone directly. Let me connect you now."

Escalation Context Package:
When escalating, the AI provides the human agent with:
- Caller's employee ID (if verified)
- Employer name and partnership status
- Summary of the conversation
- Identified needs and categories
- Any intake information already collected
- Reason for escalation

Routing Priority:
1. Crisis calls (safety, self-harm): Immediate transfer to crisis line
2. Human-requested: Next available agent
3. AI-escalated: Next available agent with context
4. Scheduled callbacks: Based on availability

Hours of Operation:
- AI assistant: Available 24/7
- Human agents: Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM EST
- Crisis support: 24/7 (transferred to 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline if after hours)
