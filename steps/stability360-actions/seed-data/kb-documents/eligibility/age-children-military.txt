Stability360 by Trident United Way

This document defines routing rules based on the client's age, household
composition, and military/veteran status.  These rules help the AI system
direct clients to the most appropriate specialized programs.

===================================================================
AGE 65 AND OLDER — SENIOR PROGRAMS
===================================================================
Clients age 65 and older should be routed to senior-specific programs
in addition to any general programs they qualify for.

Primary Referral: BCDCOG (Berkeley-Charleston-Dorchester Council of Governments)
   - Aging and Disability Resource Center
   - Phone: (843) 529-0400
   - Services: Benefits counseling, Meals on Wheels, in-home services,
     senior transportation, caregiver support

Additional Senior Resources:
   - Medicare counseling: SHIP (State Health Insurance Assistance Program)
     via BCDCOG
   - Senior housing: local housing authority senior units
   - Senior food: Meals on Wheels, congregate meal sites, SNAP for Seniors
   - Senior employment: SCSEP (Senior Community Service Employment Program)

Routing Rule: If client.age >= 65 → INCLUDE senior programs in referrals,
route to BCDCOG as primary for senior-specific needs.

===================================================================
CHILDREN UNDER 18 IN HOUSEHOLD
===================================================================
When the household includes children under 18, child-specific resources
should be included in the service plan.

Primary Referral: Siemer Institute for Family Stability
   - Part of Trident United Way
   - Parenting education, child development, family strengthening
   - Phone: (843) 740-7057

Additional Child/Family Resources:
   - Child care assistance: SC Voucher Program through SC DSS
   - After-school programs: Boys & Girls Club, YMCA
   - School supplies: Salvation Army, local churches
   - WIC (children under 5): DHEC WIC program
   - Child health insurance: SC Healthy Connections (Medicaid) or
     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
   - Child abuse/neglect reporting: SC DSS Hotline 1-888-227-3487

Special Considerations:
   - Children under 5 + utility shutoff = PRIORITY escalation
   - Single parent household = consider additional support programs
   - Teen parent = Siemer Institute + Trident Technical College resources

Routing Rule: If household.children_under_18 > 0 → INCLUDE child/family
resources, route to Siemer Institute for family-specific needs.

===================================================================

programs through the VA and Mission United.

INCLUDE VA resources in referrals.
