WHAT TO EXPECT — During and After Intake
Stability360 by Trident United Way

DURING THE CHAT
When you start a conversation with the Stability360 AI assistant (Aria):

1. GREETING: Aria will introduce herself and ask how she can help you today.

2. NEEDS ASSESSMENT: Aria will ask about your primary need (housing, food,
   utilities, employment, healthcare, etc.) and your situation.  She asks
   one question at a time to keep things simple.

3. BASIC INFORMATION: Aria will collect some basic information to help
   connect you with the right resources:
   - Your first name
   - Your ZIP code (to determine your county and local resources)
   - Your primary need and any additional needs
   - Your preferred way to be contacted (email, phone, or text)

4. RESOURCE MATCHING: Based on your answers, Aria will either:
   - Provide community resource information directly (for referrals)
   - Connect you with the Stability360 case management team (for direct
     support needs)
   - Both — provide immediate resources AND submit your information for
     case management

5. FOLLOW-UP: Before ending the conversation, Aria will:
   - Summarize what was discussed
   - Confirm the next steps
   - Schedule a follow-up if appropriate
   - Ask if you have any other questions

AFTER THE CHAT

FOR REFERRALS:

  management team
- A case manager will review your information within 24-48 hours
- The case manager will contact you using your preferred method

  needed, and the application process
- For PRIORITY cases (imminent shutoff, eviction, safety), review
  is expedited to the same business day when possible

FOLLOW-UP PROCESS:
- Automated follow-ups are scheduled to check on your progress
- Follow-ups come via your preferred contact method (email, phone, text)
