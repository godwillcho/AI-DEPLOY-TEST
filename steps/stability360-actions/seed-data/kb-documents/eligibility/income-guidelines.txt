HOW TO USE THESE GUIDELINES
===================================================================
During intake, the AI system collects the client's household size and
monthly income.  These values are used to:

1. Determine which programs the client may qualify for
2. Calculate the Self-Sufficiency Matrix employment and financial scores
3. Route the client to DIRECT SUPPORT or REFERRAL based on need level
4. Prioritize cases where income is below 100% FPL

Note: Income guidelines are for initial screening only.  Final eligibility
is determined by the specific program during their application process.
The AI system uses conditional language ("you may qualify," "you could be
eligible") rather than making definitive determinations.
