with housing, utilities, food, employment, healthcare, or other basic needs,
Stability360 connects you with the right support.

Q: Who runs Stability360?
A: Stability360 is operated by Trident United Way, a nonprofit organization

Dorchester counties.

A: Stability360 is available to anyone living in Berkeley, Charleston, or
Dorchester County who needs help accessing community resources or support
services.  There are no age, income, or citizenship requirements to begin
the intake process.  Eligibility for specific programs varies and is
determined during the intake assessment.

Q: What area does Stability360 serve?
A: Stability360 serves the tri-county area of South Carolina:
  - Berkeley County
  - Charleston County
  - Dorchester County
If you live outside this area, we recommend dialing 211 to find services
in your community.

Q: Is there a cost for Stability360 services?
A: No.  Stability360 intake and navigation services are free.  Some
community partner programs may have their own eligibility requirements
or sliding-scale fees, but the Stability360 assessment and referral
process costs nothing.

Q: What is Thrive@Work?
A: Thrive@Work is the employer-based component of Stability360.  When an
employer partners with Trident United Way, their employees gain access to
additional support services including Employee Assistance Programs (EAP),
financial coaching, and prioritized access to certain resources.  Employees
verify their eligibility by providing their employee ID.

Q: What is the difference between Stability360 and 211?
A: Both are operated by Trident United Way.  211 is a national information
and referral service — you can dial 2-1-1 to reach a specialist who can
help you find resources.  Stability360 goes further: it provides a complete
intake assessment, case management for complex needs, and follow-up to make
sure you connected with the right services.  Think of 211 as the directory
and Stability360 as the full navigation service.

Q: Is my information kept confidential?
A: Yes.  All information you share with Stability360 is kept confidential
and is used only to connect you with appropriate services.  Information is
shared with partner agencies only with your consent and only to the extent

laws and Trident United Way data protection policies.
